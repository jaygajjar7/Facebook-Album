:heavy_check_mark: slideshow will start showing photos in that album (in full-screen mode)

## Download Album

:heavy_check_mark: Beside every album icon , add a new icon/button saying “Download This Album”
:heavy_check_mark: When the user clicks on that button, your script will fetch all photos in that album behind the scene and zip them inside a folder on server.
:heavy_check_mark: You may start a “progress bar” as soon as user-click download button as download process may take time.
Once zip building on server completes, show user link to zip file.
:heavy_check_mark: When user clicks zip-file link, it will download zip folder without opening any new page.
:heavy_check_mark: Beside album names, add a checkbox. Then add a common “Download Selected Album” button. This button will download selected albums into a common zip that will contain one folder for each album. Folder-name will be album-name.
:heavy_check_mark: Also, add a big “Download All” button. This button will download all albums in a zip, similar to above.
